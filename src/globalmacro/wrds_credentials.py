"""WRDS credential resolution.

Username and password are resolved independently:

* **Username** — ``WRDS_USERNAME`` → saved state file → interactive prompt.
* **Password** — ``WRDS_PASSWORD`` → system keyring → ``$PGPASSFILE`` / ``~/.pgpass``.

When the password comes from a libpq password file, globalmacro never handles it: the
connection string omits ``password=`` and libpq reads the file itself
(:attr:`Credentials.password` is ``None``). The resolved source is printed to
stderr on every run so it is always clear which one was used.

To provision credentials, run ``globalmacro connect`` (it stores both the username and the
``~/.pgpass`` line) or export ``WRDS_USERNAME``/``WRDS_PASSWORD``. A
hand-created ``~/.pgpass`` supplies only the password, so it must be paired with
``WRDS_USERNAME`` — resolution never reads the username out of the file.

Migration (one-time, automatic, non-interactive): a legacy plaintext-keyring
entry is moved to ``~/.pgpass`` — reading only
globalmacro's own ``[WRDS]`` entry and deleting only that entry, never the shared file.
The username cache moves from ``~/.wrds_user`` to a per-OS state directory.
